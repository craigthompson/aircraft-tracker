## Running Locally

1. Clone repo
2. Change working directory into the cloned project directory
3. Install node packages `npm install`

4. Install PostgreSQL, if not already installed on machine

   - [Download PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

5. Make a .env file using the .env.example file as a template `cp .env.example .env`

   - populate the .env with the correct values including your PostgreSQL username and password.
   - You can run the app for a while whithout having an `OPENSKY_USERNAME` and `OPENSKY_PASSWORD` since they allow up to 400 requests calls. If you want to run longer (4000 requests) you can create a free OpenSky Network account.
   - You can run without a `VITE_OPENAIP_CLIENT_ID`, but you won't be able to turn on the aeronautical chart map overlay. You can optain a free account at openaip.net to get a client ID if you want to enable this feature.

6. Create database by running: `npm run db:create`

   - If you want to seed the database run: `npm run db:seed`
     - Note: Seed data has old enough lastContact timestamps that the database cleanup cron job will remove the seed data when it runs.

7. Run the app `npm run dev`
   - After running `npm run dev` you can find the URL to enter into your web browser's address bar.

## Features

- Predictive positioning and altitude for aircraft on map  
  <kbd>
    <img src="./public/assets/predictive-positioning.gif" alt="drawing" alt="Screenshot of the ADS-B receiver antenna"/>
  </kbd>
  - Implemented trigonometry to calculate next position coordinates on map using the most recently received data coordinates, velocity, and true tracking direction along with the data's capture timestamp.
  - Reduces frequency of data updates from server, since client can predict aircraft positions since last data update.
  - Creates appealing smooth movement of aircraft on map.
  - Predictively calculates altitude based on most recent data's altitude, vertical speed, and data's capture timestamp.  
- Altitude indicating colors
  - See which planes are airborne vs on the ground.
- Vertical rate indicating arrows, including indication of magnitude.
- Flight watch list
  - Airline logo
  - Flight status
  - Departure and arrival airports
- Weather radar overlay
- Multiple selectable map image layers
- Aeronautical chart elements
  - Airspaces
  - Airports and heliports
- Aircraft popup details
  - Aircraft images
  - ADS-B transmitter ICAO24 identifier
  - Callsign / registration
  - Altitude
  - Vertical speed
  - Ground speed
  - True tracking direction
- Callsign next to aircraft marker
- Ordering aircraft icons on top of others based on altitude
