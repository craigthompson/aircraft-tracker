- [Database Commands](#database-commands)

## Running Locally

1. Clone repo
2. Change working directory into the cloned project directory
3. Install node packages `npm install`

4. Install PostgreSQL, if not already installed on machine

   - [Download PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

5. Make a .env file using the .env.example file as a template `cp .env.example .env`

   - populate the .env with the correct values including your PostgreSQL username and password.

6. Create database by running: `npm run db:create`

   - If you want to seed the database run: `npm run db:seed`

7. Run the app `npm run dev`

| Command             | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run db:create` | Create database                            |
| `npm run db:seed`   | Seed the database                          |
| `npm run db:sync`   | Sync the DB                                |
| `npm run db:drop`   | Drop the DB (includes confirmation prompt) |

## Features

- Predictive position and altitude for aircraft on map
  - Implemented trigonometry to calculate next position coordinates on map using the most recent data coordinates, velocity, and true tracking direction along with the data's capture timestamp.
  - Reduces frequency of data updates from server, since client can predict aircraft positions since last data update.
  - Creates appealing smooth movement of aircraft on map.
  - Predictively calculates altitude based on most recent data's altitude, vertical speed, and data's capture timestamp.
- Altitude indicating colors
  - See which planes are airborne vs on the ground.
- Vertical rate indicating arrows, including indication of magnitude.
- Flight watch list
  - Airline logo
  - Flight status
  - Departure and arrival airports
- Weather radar overlay
- Multiple selectable map image layers
- Aeronautical chart elements
  - Airspaces
  - Airports and heliports
- Aircraft popup details
  - Aircraft images
  - ADS-B transmitter ICAO24 identifier
  - Callsign / registration
  - Altitude
  - Vertical speed
  - Ground speed
  - True tracking direction
- Callsign next to aircraft marker
- Ordering aircraft icons on top of others based on altitude
